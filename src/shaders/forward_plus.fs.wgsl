// TODO-2: implement the Forward+ fragment shader

// See naive.fs.wgsl for basic fragment shader setup; this shader should use light clusters instead of looping over all lights

// ------------------------------------
// Shading process:
// ------------------------------------
// Determine which cluster contains the current fragment.
// Retrieve the number of lights that affect the current fragment from the cluster’s data.
// Initialize a variable to accumulate the total light contribution for the fragment.
// For each light in the cluster:
//     Access the light's properties using its index.
//     Calculate the contribution of the light based on its position, the fragment’s position, and the surface normal.
//     Add the calculated contribution to the total light accumulation.
// Multiply the fragment’s diffuse color by the accumulated light contribution.
// Return the final color, ensuring that the alpha component is set appropriately (typically to 1).
